## Welcome to the Haywood Digital Corpus

Lesley and I have provided these cleaned, plain text files of Haywood's texts for instructors who want to demonstrate basic text analysis in their classrooms. The sixteen fictional texts and four play texts are titled first with the year of publication so that any comparative analysis will yield results in chronological order.

Please feel free to download the files and use them with any concordance software that takes plain text files.

If you find any problems with the texts, or have any suggestions for making the repository better, or just want to share how you have used the files, please contact me at runge@usf.edu.

Happy hunting in Haywood texts!
